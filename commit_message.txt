Fix email date filtering and database date format handling

- Fix generate_daily_report() to default to today's date when target_date=None
- Add robust date format matching in database queries to handle both ISO and RSS formats
- Update get_flagged_papers() and get_papers_by_date() to match multiple date patterns
- Fix mutt from address variable reference in notification system
- Ensure daily email reports only contain papers from the specified date

This resolves the issue where daily email reports were returning all historical
flagged papers instead of papers from the current date. The system now correctly
handles the mixed date formats (YYYY-MM-DD and "DD Mon YYYY") present in the
database and ensures proper date-specific filtering for email notifications.
