Fix DRADIS cron job hanging issue by switching to fast-harvest

- Replace regular harvest with fast-harvest in run_daily_harvest.sh to prevent analysis step hanging
- Update all template files and documentation to use fast-harvest as default method  
- Mark legacy harvest command as potentially problematic in help text
- Add privacy scanner script for repository security checks
- Update README cron examples to use reliable fast-harvest method

The regular harvest command was causing cron jobs to hang after paper harvesting,
preventing analysis and resulting in empty email reports. Fast-harvest provides
reliable paper analysis with faster execution times (2-3 minutes vs 30+ minutes).
